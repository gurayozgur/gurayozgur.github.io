# Personal Webpage of Guray Ozgur

Hi, I'm Guray! Welcome to my personal webpage, where I share my passion for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Signal Processing, and Robotics. I'm currently an M.Sc. student in Machine Learning at the Eberhard Karls University of TÃ¼bingen, where I am diving deep into the exciting world of AI and ML. My goal is to become a leading researcher and educator in these fields and make a real impact on the world.

On this website, you'll find a detailed CV that gives an insight into my professional experience and qualifications, as well as a collection of cheat sheets and tutorials that I've created to help others learn about the latest and greatest in AI and ML. I also have a blog where I share my thoughts and musings on the industry, as well as a portfolio of my projects in the field.

But that's not all. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, whether it's learning a new algorithm or taking on a new research project. So, if you're looking for inspiration or just want to have a chat about AI and ML, feel free to drop me an email or connect with me on social media.

As the field of AI and ML is rapidly evolving, I believe that the best way to predict the future is to create it. I am eager to join forces with like-minded individuals and organizations to shape the future and make a real impact.
